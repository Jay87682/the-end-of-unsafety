            <p>We live in an Age of Unsafety.</p>

            <p>This age began in <em>1972</em>, with the <em>C</em>
            language, and with <em>Unix</em>, and today it encompasses
            all that we see. Unsafety is at the foundation of the
            computing world.</p>

            <p>And now we are beset on all sides. The barbarians are
            at the gate.</p>

            <p>The internet is no longer safe, and the tools of the
            past are no longer up to the task of securing it.</p>

            <p>That is why Rust exists.</p>

            <p>Now, the Rust of 2009 was much different from the Rust
            of today. But even then, the <em>primary objective was to
            solve the memory safety problem</em>, but the assumptions were
            different.</p>

            <p>Back then, even the Rust team thought the <em>only
            viable way to solve the memory safety problem was through
            a garbage collector</em>, so Rust's heaps were garbage
            collected, but that garbage collection
            was <em>thread-local</em>.  That way garbage collection in
            one thread would not <em>interfere with progress</em> in
            other threads. This was in <em>important early
            constraint</em>, and it influenced our ultimate
            solution.</p>

            <p>Rust was, at the time, a <em>green-threaded</em>
            programming language in the style of Go, with ML
            influences.</p>

            <p>(next fragment)</p>

            <p>But these assumptions did not hold.</p>

            <li>No GC or runtime at all</li>
            <li>Traditional OS threads and concurrency</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And the reason that both these original assumptions
            didn't hold boils down to <em>performance</em> - for our
            use cases we can <em>tolerate no runtime abstraction
            costs</em>, and both garbage collection, even if it is
            single-threaded, and green-threading, impose significant
            overhead.</p>

            <p>But it took us a <em>long time</em> to come to
            this <em>conclusion</em>, and we only came to it
            <em>indirectly</em>. For a long time we thought these
            costs would be acceptable - it was only after reaching an
            important <em>insight</em> about the design of Rust that
            we realized not only the <em>importance</em>
            of <em>zero-cost abstractions</em>, but also

            <p>Let me illustrate the problem. Here we have <em>two
            isolated threads</em>, each with its own <em>heap</em> (on top),
            and <em>stack</em> (on bottom).</p>

            <p>Now, imagine I create an object in thread A's heap.</p>

            <p>(next fragment)</p>

            <p>Here represented by a blue balloon.</p>

            <p>Now, imagine that thread B wants that balloon, so I
            send it from thread A to thread B.</p>

            <p>(next fragment)</p>

            <p>So far so good. But how should the language actually
            implement that? Well, since the Rust of 2009 had isolated
            heaps, perhaps we make a <em>deep copy</em> of the
            balloon, copying the balloon over to the other heap.</p>

            But what if the balloon itself contains <em>pointers to
            other ballons</em>? And what if one of those contains a
            <em>pointer back into the stack</em>? How do you deal with
            those?

            <p>These are hard problems to solve, and it's easy to end up back in a
            situation like this...</p>

          The Rust insight
          <p class="fragment">Rust is Cyclone + Singularity</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For months we batted around this <em>problem</em>
            of <em>sending objects</em> between threads
            without <em>invalidating pointers</em>, and without a
            <em>garbage collector</em>.</p>

            <p>Around this time <em>Niko Matsakis</em> joined the
            team. Niko was an actual trained <em>type theorist</em>,
            and he brought some good ideas.</p>

            <p>Niko was looking at a research project called <em>Cyclone</em>
            and wondering if we could learn from it. Cyclone was a
            safe dialect of C that used <em>static analysis</em> to track the
            validity of pointers.</p>

            <p>Cyclone's system was somewhat limited and did not directly solve
            our multithreading problem.</p>

            <p>But also at the same time we became aware of another
            research project at Microsoft
            called <em>Singularity</em>. It was an attempt to
            reimagine the operating system in .NET. There wasn't a lot
            of information coming out of Microsoft but what caught our
            eye was their <em>approach to concurrency</em>. In
            Singularity they employed a novel technique
            to <em>transfer ownership</em> of - and <em>sole
            access</em> to - <em>entire regions of memory</em> between threads,
            by only <em>copying a pointer</em>.</p>

            <p>(next fragment)</p>

            <p>In a real sense Rust is Cyclone plus Singularity.</p>

            <p>And the result in Rust is what we call "<em>ownership and borrowing</em>".</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="OWN">
          <h3>Ownership and borrowing</h3>
          <p>In Rust, every value has a single, statically-known,
            owning path in the code, at any time.</p>
          <p>Pointers to values have limited duration, known as a
            "lifetime", that is also statically tracked.</p>
          <p>All pointers to all values are known statically.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is kind of the key takeaway of this whole presentation. Ownership
            and borrowing is what makes Rust, Rust.</p>

            <p>(read the slide verbatim)</p>

            <p>Now there are actually are caveats and exceptions, but
            if you understand this, you understand how Rust approaches
            the memory safety problem.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the neat things about ownership and borrowing as
            a computational model, is that the <em>concepts are
            familiar</em> and natural. Ownership and borrowing in Rust
            is similar to ownership and borrowing of <em>physical
            objects</em>.</p>

            <p>So this is the portion of the talk where Alex and I
            usually do a live demonstration of balloon
            borrowing. Unfortunately, I failed to acquire the
            necessary helium yesterday, so we're going to demonstrate
            virtually instead.</p>

            <p>If stickboy wanted to keep his balloon what he really

            <p>So here let's watch stickboy hand his green balloon to

            <p>(next)</p>

            <p>This time, he's handing her the balloon, but holding
            onto it himself. So when she's done peeking at it stickboy
            can just pull it right back.</p>

            <p>(next)</p>

            <p>This type of reference is called a "<em>shared reference</em>",
            and it's immutable, but there's one more type of reference

            <p>(next)</p>

            <p>And because it's a mutable reference, she can not only

            But that's just what <em>we're</em> doing to enable Rust
            <em>developers</em>. What's really going to happen over
            the next few years is that a lot of <em>world-class</em>
            software is going to be <em>written in Rust</em>. And that
            software is going to be <em>reliable, reusable, and
            maintainable</em> in ways that software written in
            memory-unsafe languages is not. These programs are going
            to enjoy <em>significant advantages</em> over their
            competition, and it will become increasingly <em>difficult
            to choose C and C++ over Rust.</em></p>

            The <em>legacy of C and C++</em> will continue for many
            decades, but <em>the future is in safety</em>. And <em>the
            future is in Rust</em>.
