# The End of Unsafety

This is a talk about how Rust will help the world move beyond the Age
of Unsafety, in which C formed the foundation of the software
world. It focuses on: the problem with the Age of Unsafety; the
creation and design of Rust; an overview of Rust today; and
projections to the future of Rust, looking beyond the Age of Unsafety.
